# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis


## Overview

I have been working with Bobby at Pewlett-Hackard to create a Postgres database containing all of the company's employees, for the initial purposes of analyzing the number of employees approaching retirement age to assist in the company's near-term planning. As the number of potential retirees in the coming years is rather large, Bobby's manager has now asked us to tally the number of retirement-aged employees per job title, as well as identify employees who would be eligible to join an employee mentorship program to train younger employees to be able to fill the shoes of those soon leaving the company.
