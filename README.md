# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis


## Overview

I have been working with Bobby at Pewlett-Hackard to create a Postgres database containing all of the company's employees, for the initial purposes of analyzing the number of employees approaching retirement age to assist in the company's near-term planning. As the number of potential retirees in the coming years is rather large - termed internally as a "silver tsunami" - Bobby's manager has now asked us to tally the number of retirement-aged employees per job title, as well as identify employees who would be eligible to join an employee mentorship program to train younger employees to be able to fill the shoes of those soon leaving the company. 

## Results
Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

As somewhat implied by the above summary, when presented with the somewhat staggering number of potential retirees (nearly 72,500!), our leadership at Pewlett immediately concluded more drilled-down data was needed to determine where within the company the impacts would be felt most.
